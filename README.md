# CityNavigator
A C# application that implements and manages a singly linked list of cities.

## Description
CityNavigator is a console-based application that enables users to maintain a list of cities using a linked list data structure. Users can add, insert, delete, and search for cities, making it a handy tool for tour planning or basic city management.

## Features
- **Add City**: Appends a city to the end of the list.
- **Insert City**: Inserts a city at a specified position.
- **Delete City**: Removes a city based on its name.
- **Search City**: Finds a city by name and displays its description.
- **Display Tour**: Visualizes the entire list of cities in the current order.

## Usage
Compile the C# program and run it:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to manage your city list.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repo-link]
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd CityNavigator
```

3. Compile and run the application:
```bash

```

## Future Enhancements
- Add a `reverse` method to reverse the order of cities.
- Implement a `sort` method to organize cities alphabetically.
- Provide functionality to update the description of existing cities.
